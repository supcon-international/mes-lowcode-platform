# Project Introduction
It's a low-code platform for users to create MES systems. Our target user is like **product manager** who is not strong in tech but has good understanding of the product that he/she wants to build. We will generate the backend and frontend for his specific MES system for different industries and allow him/her to **edit the UI or code in the embedded code editor**. 

The flow is firstlly user put in their requirements in a chat message, then we a form with the application name, industry and application type. User can edit the form or accept. After user accepted the form, the application will return a **PRD file** which is like the user requirements and features in the system. User can also edit the file and accept after their edits. After the user accepts the PRD file, the system will starts to **generate the frontend and backend system and allow the user to download or edit each file selected in the file directory**. User can also **preview the app or deploy the app**. We also want the shell to be exposed for user to see what's going on in our system and explore the system directory in **shell**.
